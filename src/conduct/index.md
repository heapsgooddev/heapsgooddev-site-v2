## PURPOSE
Heaps Good Dev was started with a goal to build a community for people who are interested in software development and technology. We want to provide a fun, welcoming and professional environment for everybody - regardless of age, experience, race, gender identity or expression, background, disability, appearance, sexuality, walk of life, or religion.

We are dedicated to making this a welcoming, harassment-free space. We invite all attendees, speakers, volunteers, sponsors, and other participants to help us realise a safe and positive community experience for everyone. We assist in this by promoting a strict zero tolerance policy on any form of harassment of Heaps Good Dev members, the members of the meetups who share our Slack, or any members of the public.

We have only one requirement to join - and that's to treat others with respect according to this Code of Conduct.

## UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR
As part of providing a safe environment we encourage our community to reach out in the event of unacceptable behaviour so that we may take appropriate action.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include, but are not limited to:

- Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

## CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR
Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated of attendees, speakers, volunteers, sponsors, and other participants of our community, including its organisers.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## SCOPE
All attendees, speakers, volunteers, sponsors and guests of Heaps Good Dev events and members of the Heaps Good Dev Slack will be held to this Code of Conduct.  Members of meetups within the Heaps Good Dev community should refer to the Code of Conduct for those communities when attending events help by the respective meetups.

## REPORTING
If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, we encourage you to please report it as soon as possible.  You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

If you feel comfortable you may reach out to one of the named contacts below who have volunteered to receive reports, or you may email us anonymously at [team@heapsgood.dev](mailto:team@heapsgood.dev).
