The Adelaide dev scene just seems to keep exploding. Almost feels at this point that you could spend a night every day of the week attending something.
I think it's a good reminder that, although the Adelaide tech community can sometimes feel a little slow moving, there's a large amount of people doing amazing things ðŸ™Œ.

This month theres a couple of new meets & events, along with a bunch of prime reading material from some super-galaxy-brain locals. Fun for the whole (engineering) family!
