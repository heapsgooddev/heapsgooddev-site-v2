## The happenin events in Adelaide

In 2019 we launched Heaps Good Dev with the intent to bring together and grow the South Australian development community. We were really happy with everyone's eagerness to jump on board and help grow Heaps Good Dev. The response in our Slack, by members of public, the event organisers and event sponsors, has been extremely exciting for us.

With that being said 2019 was very much a Proof of Concept for Heaps Good Dev. A concept we feel worked well but we would love to iterate on this year.
